## Video Overview

This introductory video covers the fundamental concepts of category theory and demonstrates how they apply to financial modeling. We'll see how functors, natural transformations, and composition give us powerful tools for thinking about derivatives and risk.

## Topics Covered

### Categories and Objects
- What is a category?
- Objects and morphisms in finance
- The category of financial instruments

### Functors as Models
- Mapping between categories
- Price functors and time series
- Preserving structure through transformations

### Composition and Pipelines
- Building complex models from simple parts
- The power of compositionality
- Type-safe financial computations

## Key Takeaways

1. **Categories provide structure** - They formalize the relationships between financial objects
2. **Functors preserve properties** - They let us transform while maintaining guarantees
3. **Composition enables reuse** - Complex systems built from verified components

## Prerequisites

Before watching this video, you should be familiar with:
- Basic set theory (sets, functions, relations)
- Elementary finance (what are stocks, bonds, derivatives)
- Basic Python or Haskell syntax

## Next Steps

After completing this video:
- Read Chapter 2 of the handbook
- Complete the exercises in the companion notebook
- Watch the next video on Measure Theory
