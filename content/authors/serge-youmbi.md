## About

**Serge Youmbi** is a functional programming enthusiast with a deep passion for category theory and its applications to software engineering. His work focuses on making advanced programming concepts accessible to practicing developers.

## Background

With experience spanning both industry and academia, Serge has worked on:
- Compiler development and program optimization
- Type system design and implementation
- Functional programming education

## The Recursion Schemes Compendium

This compendium was born from the observation that recursion schemes, despite being incredibly powerful, remain underutilized in practice. The goal is to bridge the gap between the theoretical literature and everyday programming by providing:

- Clear, intuitive explanations with practical examples
- Rigorous mathematical foundations for those who want depth
- Working Haskell code throughout
- Real-world applications in compilers, interpreters, and data processing

## Philosophy

> "The right abstraction doesn't just make code shorter—it makes impossible bugs unwritable."

Recursion schemes embody this principle: by separating *what* to compute from *how* to recurse, we eliminate entire classes of errors while gaining composability and clarity.
