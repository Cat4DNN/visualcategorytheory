## Hi, I'm Serge Youmbi

**Category Theory Enthusiast | Deep Learning Practitioner | Functional Programming Advocate**

I'm passionate about the intersection of abstract mathematics and practical machine learning. My work focuses on applying categorical structures to solve real-world problems in computational finance.

## Interests & Focus

### Category Theory & Deep Learning

I'm deeply interested in the mathematical foundations that underlie modern machine learning. Category theory provides a powerful lens for understanding neural networks, data transformations, and the compositional nature of complex systems.

### Current Learning Journey

I'm currently upgrading my grasp of advanced categorical concepts:

- **2-Categories & Bicategories** - Higher categorical structures for modeling complex relationships
- **Double Categories** - Capturing both horizontal and vertical composition
- **Sheaves & Toposes** - Generalized spaces and logic
- **Categorical Logic** - The deep connection between logic and category theory

### Collaboration

I'm always willing to collaborate on projects at the intersection of **category theory and deep learning**. If you're working on:

- Categorical foundations for neural networks
- Functorial approaches to machine learning
- Type-theoretic deep learning frameworks
- Applied category theory in finance

Let's connect!

## Functional Programming

In my spare time, I love exploring functional programming languages. There's something deeply satisfying about expressing ideas in a mathematically rigorous way:

<div class="row mt-4 mb-4">
<div class="col-md-4">
<div class="card h-100">
<div class="card-body text-center">
<h4>Haskell</h4>
<p class="text-muted">Pure functional programming with strong static typing and lazy evaluation</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<div class="card h-100">
<div class="card-body text-center">
<h4>Scala</h4>
<p class="text-muted">Blending functional and object-oriented paradigms on the JVM</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<div class="card h-100">
<div class="card-body text-center">
<h4>OCaml</h4>
<p class="text-muted">Pragmatic functional programming with excellent type inference</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

These languages share a common thread: they make it natural to think in terms of composition, types, and mathematical structures - the same concepts that drive category theory.

## About This Book

This handbook represents my attempt to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical beauty and practical computational finance. By viewing financial systems through a categorical lens, we can:

- **Identify deep patterns** that connect seemingly disparate areas
- **Build composable systems** that are easier to reason about
- **Leverage type safety** to catch errors at compile time
- **Apply ML rigorously** with mathematical foundations

Whether you're a mathematician curious about finance, a quant looking for new perspectives, or a developer interested in functional approaches to trading systems, I hope this book provides valuable insights.
